#Context
This task focuses ONLY on updating wording, labels, and microcopy on the existing Research page.
Do NOT refactor logic, layout, or components.
Do NOT introduce new features.
Treat this as a content + UX language pass.

The goal is to make the Research page feel:
- More creator-friendly
- Less technical
- More spacious and breathable
- Bold, calm, quirky, and trustworthy

Think “creative studio” instead of “analytics dashboard”.

#Goal
Improve the naming and copy of key sections so creators immediately understand:
- what this space is for
- how to use it
- how it supports their creative identity and brand growth

Remember this space is introduced after the users/creators have already seen the "profile page" that states their creative DNA, content creation goals, superpowers and growth zones

Reduce density, minimise words, clearer intent.

#Task
##For Strategy, Themes and Brands box
- Rename this section with a single creator-friendky name that feels natural, warm and non-corporate. Examples include (do not hardcode this exact wording un;ess it fits cleanly)
    + “Your Creative Playbook”
    + “Your Content Blueprint”
    + “Your Creative World”
    + “Your Creator Foundations”
- Replace the current existing labels: Ideas, Themes. Strategies and Brands. Instead, inside this section, there should be four sub-areas using simple language
1. Content Lanes
    + What the user consistently talk about from their previous videos after analysis
    + Examples: uni life, food, wellness, fashion
    + Position as “the worlds you show up in”

2. Formats
   + How they show up on camera
   + Examples: vlogs, camera-facing, montages
   + Keep this practical and skimmable

3. Recurring Series:
   + Their repeatable creator “recipes”
   + These shape their personal brand identity
   + Example framing: “things people come back for”, what defines their image among audiences, their own iconic self

4. Brand Fit
   + Brands they want to attract
   + A space to explore alignment between:
     - brand tone
     - creator personality
     - content direction
   + Frame as “who you want noticing you”, not sponsorship mechanics

IMPORTANT:
- Avoid corporate language
- Avoid long explanations
- Use short headers + one-line supporting text
- Let whitespace do the work

##For Research Chat Box
- Rename "Research Chat" into "Our Brainstorming Space" or "Our Collaborative Zone"
- Subtitle
    - This should clearly state that this is a creative, collaborative thinking space.
    - Tone: creative director energy, not chatbot energy.
    - Example direction (adapt as needed): “This is where you think like a creative director — with backup.”
- In the "Research Kickoff" section
    - Instead of saying "Drop a creator detail or target sponsor to map insight summaries, positioning, and assets in one place.", pick up where have been left off from the "Profile page", think like building a storyteling. Start with something like "Now moving on to the fun stuff, let me work my magic to drive your next moves in your creator journey"
    - Then add a short instructional copy/block explaining how to use this space pre-chat
        - This should:
            - Feel inviting, not instructional
            - Reduce intimidation
            - Encourage experimentation
        - Structure:
            - One short intro line
            - Followed by example prompts (not a paragraph)
            - Example prompt styles to include:
                - “Give me ideas for a brand deal with X”
                - “Help me make my content stand out”
                - “What worked best in my niche this month?”
                - “Draft 5 hooks for my next vlog”
        - Guidelines:
            - Keep it light
            - Keep it scannable
            - Do NOT over-explain how the AI works

#Constraints
- Do NOT change component structure
- Do NOT add new UI elements beyond text blocks
- Do NOT reduce clarity for style
- Maintain consistency with existing Research / Generate / Plan page tone

#Expected Outputs
- Updated copy only
- Clearer section naming
- More breathing room
- Creator-native language
- No logic or layout regressions
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness.

#Follow-up Context
This prompt extends the previous instruction.
The structure and layout already exist.
This task is about:
- example placeholder content
- tone calibration
- demonstrating how information should be broken down visually

Do NOT overfill the UI.
These are illustrative examples only.

#Task
##"Your Creative Blueprint" content
- Use the following as SAMPLE PLACEHOLDER CONTENT to guide hierarchy and tone.
- Do not render as a single paragraph.
- Each sub-area should feel scannable and calm.

1. Content Lanes
- Purpose: What this creator naturally shows up for.
- Example placeholder items:
    - Uni life & routines
    - Café hopping
    - Solo runs around the city
    - Quiet night resets
- Tone: Casual, human, recognisable.
- Visual Intent
    - Lane title = primary
    - One short supporting line underneath

2. Formats
- Purpose: How the creator prefers to tell stories.
- Example placeholder items:
    - Day-in-the-life vlog
    - Voiceover + B-roll
    - Camera-facing reflections
    - Photo dumps with captions
- Use: Chips, badges, or inline tags.

3. Recurring Series
- Purpose: These are the creator’s “recipes”. Repeatable ideas that build identity.
- Example placeholder items:
    - Runs I Almost Skipped
    - Sundays Reset With Me
    - Meals That Took 10 Minutes
    - Quiet Moments After 9PM
- Guidance: These should feel like branded rituals, not one-off posts.
- Visual Intent:
    - Series title as headline
    - One-line explanation beneath
    - Feels like a recognizable show format

4. Brand Fit
- Purpose: Signal which brands already align with this creator’s vibe.
- Example placeholder items:
    - Nike  
    Fits my running journey and everyday movement content.
    - Lululemon  
    Calm routines, wellness, lifestyle storytelling.
    - Apple  
    Clean visuals, productivity, creative workflows.
- Tone: Confident, alignment-first. Not salesy.
- Visual Intent:
    - Brand name
    - Short reason underneath (muted, optional)

##"Our Brainstorming Space" Conversation (Pseudo/Hypothetical)
- Use the following to seed example content for the chat experience. This is NOT hardcoded logic, just illustrative copy.
- Instruction shown above chat input: Before "Just start typing — we'll figure it out together.", add something like "Think out loud here. Ask for ideas, clarity, or creative direction."
- Example User Input:
    - Instead of "Looking for beauty brands that care about science-backed routines."
    - Replace with something like "I want a running series that doesn’t feel intimidating or try-hard."
- Example AI Response (Tone Reference)
“Yeah, totally get that.
What if running is just the backdrop, not the main character?
A few ideas that feel low-pressure:
1. ‘Runs I Almost Skipped’  
Honest, very relatable. People connect with the struggle more than the pace.
2. ‘One Run, One Thought’  
Short reflections while cooling down. Calm, repeatable, brand-safe.
3. ‘Running Days That Felt Like Therapy’  
Leans into emotion, not performance.
None of these need to be perfect or intense.
They work because they feel like real life.
Want to shape one of these into a weekly format?”
